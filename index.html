            <p style="color: white;">Or better still, the transition from a MVP to a MVO, to a million users worthy
              startup is what can happen here. This means, founding teams working on various startups in TSF have built the proposed solution/MVP
                just about good enough, tested by their early adopters and finally well packaged for marketing. It is at this stage where we can be utilised the best. 
		The marketers and sales vendors of Preseed may join hands with them to bring early adopters/customer traction to these flawless MVPs.
                Basically, this is also where your products can be scaled up, out of proportion.
		    <br>
                What is good enough?
                Good enough means that the MVP should be used well by the early users, It doesn't not necessarily be perfect or even 
                beautiful. But, have a MVP. Have something more than just an idea, is our point.</p>

                    If you can keep your head when all about you <br>

                    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, <br>

                    If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, <br>

                    But make allowance for their doubting too; <br>

                    If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, <br>

                    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, <br>

                    Or being hated, don’t give way to hating, <br>

                    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: <br>

                    If you can dream — and not make dreams your master; <br>

                    If you can think — and not make thoughts your aim; <br>

                    If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster <br>

                    And treat those two impostors just the same; <br>

                    If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken <br>

                    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, <br>

                    Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, <br>

                    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: <br>

                    If you can make one heap of all your winnings
                    <br>
                    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, <br>

                    And lose, and start again at your beginnings <br>

                    And never breathe a word about your loss; <br>

                    If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew <br>

                    To serve your turn long after they are gone, <br>

                    And so hold on when there is nothing in you <br>

                    Except the Will which says to them: “Hold on!” <br>

                    If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
                    <br>
                    Or walk with Kings — nor lose the common touch, <br>

                    If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, <br>

                    If all men count with you, but none too much; <br>

                    If you can fill the unforgiving minute <br>

                    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run, <br>

                    Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it, <br>

                    And — which is more — you’ll be a Man, my son! <br>

        we are not keen on making an investment in you. We are not in the business of stating reasons. The
        reasons may have more to do with us, than you. Anyway, the following buttons reveal what can be our chance or path to work together, in case we decide not
        to participate by directly investing money into your startup:

                      <p name="3caf">A traditional startup incubator &mdash; is a startup incubator that incubates a startup company of 2 or more people that has achieved some real traction in their product. This means that a traditional incubator invests about Rs. X lakhs in that startup and houses that startup for 3 months under their own roof to open an environment of co-learning among all entrepreneurs with its other portfolio startups under that same roof. So, the incubator is an investor that guides or invests their time in guiding you.</p>
                      <p name="a204"><b>How it works<b> &mdash; It takes 5% to 10% ownership in that startup for doing so. Such incubators are basically, funds. They take investments from other investors and invest that pool of money as a fund, per batch of 10 or more such companies.</p>
                      <p name="2e6d">We are not that nor will we be that.</p>
                      <p name="431c">When we become a fund ourselves, we will invest in startups that don&rsquo;t need anything from us, other than the money. Basically startups we think that will be a grand success without our mental hustle for them. This will save us our time in indulging in matters of your operations to put time into startups that need our time, not our money first.</p>
                      <p name="28f7">So, there are two categories of startups we have:

			<b>Ourfund will invest in two kinds of opportunities -</b>  <br>
          1. The ones that require an investment of upto Rs. 10 Lakhs. <br>
          2. The others that require an investment of above Rs. 10 Lakhs. <br>
          <br><br>
          For the ones that require less than 10 Lakhs in investment we may come back to them with several milestone to achieve. The milestones that can be achieved before investments.
          What could these milestone be? <br> <br>
          Here is a possible example - The team of a startup when ready with their MVP, adhering by our 'Product
          Packaging Protocols' suggested specially for them, which will be told to them on their call with Nishchal. Founders will be required to fulfil Nishchal's requirements absolutely. It could be
          as simple as 5,000 subscribers for their landing page(regardless of active users) for their product within the a given achievable
          span of time. <br> <br>
          Sometimes milestone we set might seem odd. Why? 
          Any milestone we set, will not necessarily be about growing the company monetarily alone.<br> <br>
<br> So, you bsolute focus, trust and discipline
          is what we seek in a strong progressive team- to switch off from all else, and just get that one task done
          and completed rightly - The task we gave as your set milestone. A founder like this deserves this fund.
          As soon as this is achieved, the money will be in their bank account. No further questions asked, no
          projections asked, no slide decks exchanged. <br> <br>
          This initial Rs. 10 Lakhs, will help each of the teams of these startups to sustain themselves, while
          looking for outside investors without being in a hurry to close a deal, with a wrong investor.<Br><br>
          Why does TSF finvest time in signing Rupees 10 Lakhs cheques at all? <br> 
          Well, simply put, to motivate each of these teams to achieve their goals, guided by us now. We are
          careful about investment quality for foudners. They must be nvested upon by the best suited investors if they are our portfolio startup. It's quite easy to go
          wrong with the selection of investors within the Indian Subcontient. (No offense to anyone in particular! ). Often there are many investors with tons of money, but not the right mind to advise these startups in the
          right direction. The mind wouldn't matter, if such folks gave these teams the freedom to move and grow on
          their own, but more often than not, there is way too much intrusion from such investors' end. And why should
          the investors not be intrusive? After all it's their money. There is also a lack of faith exhibited by both
          ends. Thus its supremely important to grow and nurture ones startup along side the right farmer, in this
          case, a suitable investor. So, to say the
          least these 10 Lakhs will buy these startups some time. <br> <br>
          Usually a startup may want to raise Rupees 50 Lakhs for the next 6 months, at this early stage. We want to
          sort the startup out for the first 2 months, so they can be free willed to choose the right investor to
          marry their product with, in case they are neat in the business process so far. <br> <br>
          I hope the readers of www.preseed.in are getting the sense of entrepreneurial problems, Nishchal, who is building his own product startups in India, to create better leaders, from scratch, wants to solve accross its Gamut of works.
           <br> <br>
          In short, achieve that milestone set specifically for your team (for your own growth), and get your frist cheque from TSF when TSF is ready with its fund for you, until then, try getting our attention.
          Good luck fellows! <br>

                    process we keep hustling from your side of the table to help you receive investment to the point of

                    impactful and aligned handshakes. While in the process the founders get money perhaps worth exactly equal to
                    the amount they were originally seeking from us.
			<br><br>
			
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">Matches made in heaven</span> - If the deal goes through, we take
             upto 10% commission and some equity. Why ? Because we make matches between investors and
                    startups that add value in each other far beyond money. However, most importantly, we are getting
                    you the most important immediate resource your business needs. Money. When Preseed introduces you,
                    it matters. We have worked very hard to have now built an extraordinary network of those with money
                    and will to aid an early stage startup. We have prepared most in our network to have that will, to
                    support you with their time and money. We are charging you for that hard work of ours if it brings
                    investment to you.<br><br>

                    Before you proceed to dialogue with those we introduce you to, accept words written in contract with

                      table — money, which is the next key to unlock your growth.<br><br>

                      Our commissions rates are fixed on actual investment achieved. every single time you receive
                      investment from anyone we introduce you to, or, say, if you receive investments from any of the

                        Sometimes we charge commission or any other service fee from the investor too. If Preseed makes any gain on it, it belongs to Preseed, it should not be a
                        matter of concern to either the startup or the investor. For both startup and the investor got

                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">For investors:</span><br><br>
                    As a matter of policy Preseed values a startup at a <span style="font-weight: bold;">post Preseed
                      handshake</span> stage, at a minimum of 1 crore before it brings it forward for investment to the
                    potential investor.<br><br>
                    The investors are requested to also bet on the fact that what Preseed is brining to them as a
                    dealflow, once was a mere set of humans with no startup in hand worthy enough, and it was at this
                    time that Preseed held their hand to add its own input into that startup for years, from when
                    founders were early 20 year old kids to now — when they are sitting in front of you.<br><br>
                    To say the least, anything lower in valuation is exploitation of Preseed's network,
                    their do good hippie spirit and their modern collective of visions. Startup assets which Preseed develops
                    relationships with over years are very very valuable, because our network's
                    entrepreneurial foundations are strong and deep. 
			<br><br>A big part of the reason the startup will be
                    successful is that it has us with them over a deal in good faith and words a couple of years ago and
                    the startup decided to keep their word to us forever.<br><br>
                    Anything we bring to you, no matter what you can do with it or not, never value it at less than 1 crore if you are suggesting a deal at all. I
                    will not be interested in bringing anything to you if that be the case. It’s a matter of policy at
                    Preseed and generally in all startup friendly logics in the world, that we accept a valuation of at
                    least 1 crore. Anything of less value is not worth anyone of our's time. 
                    If we don’t get this right among you and I, a lot between us may be missed.<br><br>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold;">No small talks of collateral, security, safety etc.</span> please.
                    If you are looking for that, you are at the wrong place. This is about status quo changing
                    possibilities that go to values of billions someday, but today may be just a person with a great portotype. Our investor friend has simply gotta be
                    prepared to bear the cost of owning the proposed equity. Simple business math  -  they pay a cost to
                    own some asset, in this case, not a piece of land, but a piece of a large possibility. High risk,
                    sky high rewards. <br><br>
                    Think of the deal with our portfolio startup, like this:<br><br>
                    Value any startup I bring such that, if you were to own all of it, you were willing to pay 1 crore
                    of upfront cost for 100% of it. Because the value of what I am bringing to you is greater than the
                    possession of a 1 crore plot.<br><br>
                    You are buying a piece of a larger piece of a real estate plot, so that it gives you gains in the
                    future. This piece of land would at least be worth Rs. 1 crore. How do you buy a piece of plot less
                    than that in a prime market of your city? You don't. So is the reason that you can't buy the startup
                    we will be bringing to you at less than that value.<br><br>

                    "My journey so far and our Google ranking has brought me to a place where a lot of early stage very
                    good startup deals get known to me before they get known to anyone else.
                    <br>
                    At this stage that startup is generally a good looking opportunity either because: <br>
                    <br>
                    1. The startup founder of it is really really smart. <br>
                    2. The product looks like it could one day be with millions of users. <br>
                    3. In some cases the customer metrics are already solid. <br>
                    <br>
                    Normally the startups and entrepreneurs within the scope of Dealflow are going to be early stage
                    startups looking to raise anywhere between 5 Lakhs to 5 crores.
                    <br>
                    Our plausible revenue would be -: <br>
                    1. Commission from startups. <br>
                    2. Annual fees from funds/investors. <br>
                    3. Equity from startups. <br>
                    <br>
                    I want to build Dealflow and observe the trend, get into deal flows and learn in the process more
                    and more about early stage startup investments and good opportunites, to build an early stage
                    startup research company that researches on investment performance of early stage startups to get
                    trends and experiences.
                    <br>
                    We will, eventually, over a 10 year period, want to make TSF into a fund+company that investors go to for
                    getting esrliest deal flow and advisory all at the same time, in context to early stage startup investments.
                    Because of us, investors should be able to put their money at a better and more calculated
                    opportunity".

           <p align="center" style="font-size: 1.2em;">As a part of Nishchal's job at <a href="http://preseed.in/">www.preseed.in</a>, he often chances upon opportunities he would have wished to invest monetarily
          in, if he had personal wealth of that magnitude. It is exactly for the reason of making such investments that we wish to build this fund. <br>
          If we do the sum total of all the decks we have recevied and divide the by 12 months, the result will be 20. Which means we have to deal with 20 decks every month from this year of 2022 and onwards. Some of those
          pitches seem worth investing in. However, some is not what we are after. Just one more is what we are after. Our first investment in a company will be in a company we would have wanted to build ourselves. <br>
		    Expect to have the Preseed Yoga touch across all the stages mentioned in the link above, over a long period of time. Everything we think, do and say, is within a long-term mental space in which our collective business will be built.
We have noticed, that most of what is being done in the startup ecosystem in India is largely aimed at those with business plans, and not necessarily at people with great minds, interested in solving very real fundamental problems.
And rightly so, if you have a great mind, write a book, but if you have a great plan, build an enterprise, be an entrepreneur. Be the change and then make that change with your daily hustle on our guidance. Our work will encourage you to dive in as a philosopher and come out as a social entrepreneur. </p>

Pay a lot of attention on your co worker's mental health and growth. If they
            are not geniuses, make them so. If you have a loyal worker, work as hard as it takes to make him/her/(whatever other pronouns the world is after) the person
            you need. Often, you will need a humble hard working parter
            who is willing to take that leap into your whim. Find that partner/co-founder soon". <br> - Nishchal

            Our team and extended network has fair knowledge about what is going on in the webosphere, the world of innovation/markets/finance the way we look at it, and that makes our team
            identify novelty really well.

            get discovered by those who open this website. It may lead to some solid connection for your idea/startup.
            Many talented people open this webpage daily, and get led to developing relationships with our startups.

			Nishchal was the one who connected the two parties in <a href="https://yourstory.com/2015/09/gamexs-funding/amp" target="_blank">this deal</a> for startup by an IITian, GameXS.in. He also connected Jitendra from Chicago Booth and Pritesh from IIT Kharagpur, which facilitated the creation of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zipgo">Zipgo</a>. 
			Around the same time Nishchal was offered to join India's pioneering coworking spaces company, 91 Springboard, as a co-founder, and a little later, to join Embibe.com (bought majorly by Reliance for about 180 million dollars, a few years later), as a director. But, Nishchal decided to run Preseed instead. His goal was to directly, wholly and intellectually, assist entrepreneurs in building their startups.
				   <Br><br>
Nishchal had dropped out of college in 2007, to build a social network. He had raised nearly a $100,000 in investment and a team of 12 mostly from IIT Delhi. 
		      This team later on went on to become founders of companies like Glowing.io, Vertoe.com, Webkul.com, etc. Some of these company are backed by world's best early stage startup incubators like Y Combinator and Techstars in America. 
		      Nishchal's network is made up of such founders from his own team of 2009 to investors in 2022. <br><br>
          <p align="center" style="font-size: 1.2em;">

            <b> Why the standard question of traction may not be the most
                appropriate question for a moonshot innovation in its nascent stage when
                founders are seeking support from investors to continue their R&D
                towards
                launch?</b> <br><br>

            For now, let's turn the lens on another kind of traction- which we have
            already created- meaningful moments and activities noticed by users, media
            and the tech community. <br><br>
            I often wonder if my life would be the same inspired life if I was chasing
            traction instead of a chasing a world changing vision which did not fit the
            bill for the rule of - build MVP - followed by traction, before I could
            raise money. Please tell me how I would then change the world for the
            better? <br><br>
            Start-up land is littered with failure. <br><br>
            Every hack on smart investing will preach that before approaching an
            investor you must have dragged your feet over the thorns littered over that
            holiest of grails- TRACTION. For after all what good is a business that does
            not yield profits? Yet, if that critical question on TRACTION is duly asked
            and answered before any investment, why the high rates of failure and a
            subsequent celebration of failure as the norm in start-up land?
            Could it be that the holy grail itself is flawed in a period where most of
            our problems have been solved or are perceived to have been solved to an
            acceptable degree beyond which improvements are not possible in a human,
            hence imperfect world? <br><br>
            I say YES. <br><br>
            Most start-ups offer incremental changes, but what if you had a moon- shot
            innovation for a problem the world has ceased to consider as one. Or a
            problem considered solved? <br><br>
            Moonshots, by their very definition, need to be hurtled until something big
            is identified. The innovation after that identification might take time, in
            some cases, a very long time. (Would you not say that the problem you are
            addressing is a blind spot- that the best in chatting-productivity has been
            achieved and that is just the start of the moon shot you must make to
            disrupt existing models of education?)

            Imagine, if you were the only person with the vision that there was scope
            for yet another chat app for people who were looking to be productive over
            chats and the rest of the world did not agree with you.
            <br><br>
            <i> Imagine if you did not know how to code, nor did you have the
                time to learn how to code.</i>
            No big deal there. Watch what Sam Altman has to say about this:

            Yes, you can’t code, don’t have the time to learn so you hire the best
            to code for you. It must not surprise you that great people come at a
            cost. Those great people may have had a life of their own before they
            met a vision that I imparted to them and wished to be consumed by it but
            for the mundane but real considerations of everyday living. <br><br>
            More so, one requires neat sums of money for the world will not accept a
            MVP that challenges its collective blind spot. <br><br>
            So, my challenge is to manifest a never-before vision into a
            finger-licking good looking product that elicits a collective gasp of
            “why did we not see that earlier”, from the world. <br><br>
            (To those who repeat the trite Form Follows Function rule, let me quote
            just one example- Snapchat, that turned that norm on its head. It was a
            beautiful but tedious product to begin with. It bettered itself over
            time) <br><br>
            Money, of course- now. <br><br>
            Traction, not just yet. <br><br>

            So, let's let Preseed run in the nomadic boundless 'hippie, no excel sheet,
            no
            slide deck, no running after investors, no giving or taking unnecessary
            repetitive gyan. Let Preseed speak to partners and other vested interests
            after
            you, only through substantial results weighed only in millions of clear
            dollars
            and millions of users of our products. Until we reach there, we need your
            understanding.
